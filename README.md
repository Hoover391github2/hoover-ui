Advanced UI for [Hoover](https://hoover.github.io)

## Installation

Working on the UI needs a recent nodejs (see 'engine' in package.json for the version currently used).

1.  Download the code, install dependencies

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/hoover/ui.git
    cd ui
    npm install
    ```

2.  Development

    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  Building

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

## Deployment

The UI is just a bunch of static files, they are generated in the `build`
folder. They consume the API of
[Hoover-Search](https://github.com/hoover/search). It can serve these files
from disk if you set `HOOVER_UI_ROOT` in `hoover/site/settings/local.py` to the
path of the UI's `build` folder.

## Development

If you don't want to install Hoover-Search locally, you can develop against a
remote server.

```shell
HOOVER_REMOTE_SEARCH_URL=https://hoover.crji.org/ npm run dev
```

The UI is served at `http://localhost:3000` and API calls are proxied to the
remote server.

## Node upgrade

Upgrading the node version requires a version bump in the following files:

-   package.json (`engine`)
-   .travis.yml
-   Dockerfile
